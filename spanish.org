** Grammar rules

# More simple cards -- here the question and answer are produced purely using
# cloze deletion of test in [square brackets], without the need to hide any
# subtopics (though they WILL still be hidden if present).

# If the text between the brackets contains a `|' character, everything after
# that character is considered to be a `hint', and will remain visible when the
# rest of the clozed text is hidden.

# Set the variable `org-drill-use-visible-cloze-face-p' to `t' if you want 
# cloze-deleted text to be shown in a special face when you are editing org
# mode buffers.

** Vocabulary

# Examples of 'twosided' cards. These are 'flip cards' where one of the
# first 2 'sides' (subheadings) is presented at random, while all others stay
# hidden. 

# There is another builtin card type called 'multisided'. These are like
# 'twosided' cards, but can have any number of sides. So we could extend the
# examples below by changing their type to multisided and adding a third
# subheading which contains an inline image.
